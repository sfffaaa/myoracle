Because I want to test the backend script, so ...
1. Add test smart contract with sent requests to oraclecore
2. After calling that, the callback should be called, so the smart contract needs have related function to verify.
3. Implement the testcase in javascirpt
4. Implemetn the testcase in python
5. After finished it, the oraclecore function should be change and it will influence the testcase, too.
