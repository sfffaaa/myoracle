Todo
Q: Right now, oracle can be called repeated, but how can user pay the oracle fee when calling oracle repeatly...
Q: The permission should be checked again, because I found TestStorage didn't have permission check.
Q: How about the gas spent in multiple users
Q: TestWallet not use right now, maybe the code should be removed.
Q: Move storage in TestWalletDistributor to TestStorage
Q: Use TestRegister instead of OracleRegister
Q: Use TestRegister in TestStorage for avoid setting address here
Q: Change permission for TestWalletDistributor

Pending:
Report of address called.


Finish
Q: Because I want to test the backend script, so ... (FINISHED!!)
	1. Add test smart contract with sent requests to oraclecore
		1.1. When I implement the base class and try to test how example oracle communicate to oraclecore, I found I need
			 to add an array for verifying queryId is correct or not.
	2. After calling that, the callback should be called, so the smart contract needs have related function to verify.
		2.1. callback cannot be called due to node daemon doesn't run... but we can do it manually by myself..
	3. Implement the testcase in javascirpt
	4. Implemetn the testcase in python
	5. After finished it, the oraclecore function should be change and it will influence the testcase, too.
A: Backend script is added.

Q: Permission Implement. (FINISHED!!)
   I don't want to use this.functioncall, because it will cost more gas here, but that means I need to allow some user to call or change the public function to private...
A: Still need use this!! because I don't want other people call the smart contract directly. I want to write an payment mechanism...

Q: if there is nothing, getLastestId will fail... (FINISHED!!)
A: It will encounter required fail.

Q: The contract (TestWalletDistributor) should allow mulitple user to deposit their ether.
A: Now support multiple user right now

Q: Add payment test
A: Add TestOracleExample + OracleCore test case
