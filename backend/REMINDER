add more test case

Maybe I can use event base to kill the callback function which runs too long


1. test case for callback to call callback. It will need web server for myself
2. contract object can connect to contract on chain object instead of write function for passing data again in order to avoiding carelessness.


Note:
1. If someone want to add new smart contract, user needs add smart contract object and smart contract onchain handler object as a gateway in order let user can interact with ethereum network. For simplification's sake, the contract function should be named start from "c_" in smart contract onchain object, and the framework will automatically connect it to smart contract object. You can see the detail implementation in function "_expose_contract_function" in "BaseContract".
